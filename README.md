## Overview

### The challenge

Test the functions in order, starting with `calculateAge`, followed by `calculateTax` and `greet`.

Ensure you complete success, failure and malformed tests where possible.

Ensure every use case of each function is fully tested.

## My process

### What I learned

First time using JEST to implement unit testing for javascript. In particular enjoyed using the process of unit testing to improve the original functions provided - specifically the 'greet' function where I added Error handling

### Useful resources

- https://jestjs.io/docs/expect - JEST documentation very helpful
